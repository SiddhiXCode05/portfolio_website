## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
This project functions as a static site, serving content directly to the browser. Data for skills and projects is managed through local JSON files, eliminating the need for a traditional database. The architecture is straightforward: user requests content, and the server (or hosting service) delivers pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript then dynamically populates sections using data from the JSON files.
